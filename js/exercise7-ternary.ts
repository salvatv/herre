/*
· Recreate the logic below with the ternary operator (?). 
The ternary operator can be used to look for null but what it’s really doing is 
creating conditional logic based on a true/false response. If null then false is returned.

    var myVal: number = null;
    var result: number = null;

    // using an if statement
    if (myVal == null) {
        result = 0;
    }
    else {
        result = myVal;
    }

· Now change the “myVal” variable to equal 5 and execute operation again. Result is now set equal to “myVal” because “myVal” is not null.

// Vamos!
console.log("Vamos!");
